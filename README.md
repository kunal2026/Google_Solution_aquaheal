<h1>AquaHeal - Water Quality Estimation and Disease Prediction</h1>
<hr>
Welcome to the AquaHeal repository! 
<br>
<li>Here, we're dedicated to improving global access to safe drinking water by estimating its quality index and predicting the occurrence of waterborne diseases across various geographical regions.</li>
<hr>
About Us:<br>
Established in 2024, AquaHeal aims to deliver precise estimates of regional drinking water quality indices and forecast potential waterborne disease outbreaks.
Our team consists of highly motivated individuals who share a passion for ensuring clean water as a fundamental human right.
<hr>
Our Mission:<br>
To provide accurate assessments of drinking water quality using advanced analytical techniques and machine learning models.
To anticipate and prevent waterborne illnesses through proactive monitoring and early warning systems.
<hr>
Challenges:<br>
We faced challenge as finding a dataset for water borne diseases proved to be a difficult task. We also found integrating the model to be difficult.
Our team members had no prior knowledge about video editing and thus it proved to be a tedious task.
Also, we were notified about hackathon very lately, so due to time constraints, we couldn't maximise our potential to solve the problem statements. 
To overcome these issues, we read research articles to gain enough information to help us in the issues that we had faced.
